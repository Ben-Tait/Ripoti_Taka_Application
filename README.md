# Ripoti Taka: A Web Application to Mobilize Citizen Participation in Solid Waste Management in Nairobi

## Project Overview
Solid waste management in Nairobi County faces challenges such as inadequate coverage, uncontrolled dumping, inefficient services, unregulated private sector involvement, and insufficient infrastructure, leading to health risks and environmental damage. This research project aims to enhance waste management through "Ripoti Taka," a web platform that allows citizens to monitor and report waste management issues. Using geotagged reports with descriptions and visual evidence, the platform fosters collaboration between citizens and authorities. Developed using the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM), Ripoti Taka leverages ArchGIS for reverse geolocation, Leaflet JS for interactive mapping, and Flask for web rendering. By identifying problem areas through interactive maps, the system supports sustainable waste management in Nairobi County and can serve as a model for other counties.
