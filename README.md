# Introduction
## Background Information
Solid waste, which refers to unwanted and unusable materials that we get rid of, presents a 
major challenge in Nairobi City County. The improper practices related 
to managing waste, such as handling, storing, collecting, transporting, and disposing of it, result 
in risks to public health and harm to the environment. Nairobi produces an 
astounding 4,016 tonnes of municipal solid waste every day, a number forecasted by Allison and likely influenced by factors like population growth, urbanization, changes in 
lifestyle, and industrial activities. 

Illegal dumping is a significant issue, with traditional waste collection services struggling to keep up. 
According to BNK Njoroge, M. Kimani, and D. Ndunge, an estimated 2,690 tonnes of 
garbage remain uncollected daily. This waste is often either burned or disposed of improperly, 
worsening the situation. The negative effects of improper waste disposal are severe, impacting 
both public health and the environment, particularly in developing countries and urban areas.Limited citizen involvement poses a significant 
challenge in addressing the waste management challenges in Nairobi. 

Informal settlements bear the brunt of this issue, as overflowing bins and uncollected garbage are a common occurrence. 
The lack of a centralized reporting system prevents authorities from fully understanding the 
scale of the problem, thus hindering the implementation of specific solutions. When residents 
feel disconnected from the waste management process, they may develop feelings of apathy or 
helplessness, ultimately failing to hold authorities responsible for efficient waste collection and 
disposal while there are efforts in place to encourage public engagement in waste management, they often do not meet expectations. Social media, a widely 
used platform for highlighting waste-related issues, lacks a centralized system for monitoring 
and solving these issues. 

Although initiatives such as community clean-up events and 
awareness campaigns are praiseworthy, their impact and sustainability are often limited. A more structured and centralized approach to 
involving citizens is urgently required. The proposed solid waste reporting system, Ripoti Taka, 
has the potential to transform waste management in Nairobi. Through collaboration with the 
city authorities, empowering residents to report waste concerns, and enhancing transparency in 
the process, Ripoti Taka could result in a 14% enhancement in solid waste management.

## Problem Statement
Poor solid waste management in Nairobi is characterized by rudimentary waste storage, lack 
of engineered landfill facilities, environmental concerns, and a policy-action gap due to non cooperation and poor law enforcement. The ideal scenario for solid waste 
management involves active citizen participation throughout the county. However, the reality 
is one of limited and unstructured citizen participation amid poor solid waste management. 
Informal channels like social media platforms are used for reporting but lack a centralized 
system for tracking and resolving problems. Localized initiatives exist but have limited reach 
and sustainability. 

This lack of structure creates an information gap: authorities lack real-time 
data on problem areas, hindering targeted solutions. The limited citizen participation in 
Nairobi's waste management system hinders efforts towards achieving sustainable waste 
management. This research project proposes the development and implementation of a web 
application called Ripoti Taka to bridge this gap. Ripoti Taka will empower citizens to report 
waste issues, fostering collaboration with authorities and promoting transparency. By 
addressing this critical problem, Ripoti Taka has the potential to transform waste management 
in Nairobi, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment for all residents.
## Objectives
### General Objective
To develop a web application that allows residents within a specific area to report poorly 
disposed solid waste for collection.
### Specific Objectives
* To study and investigate the current state of public participation in solid waste 
management in Nairobi City County
* To investigate the challenges facing the current solid waste reporting channels.
* To study how existing technologies have been used in solid waste management.
* To design and develop a web-application to assist in the reporting of poorly 
disposed waste.
* To test and validate the proposed web-application.
## Research Questions
